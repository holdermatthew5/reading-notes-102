# What is a growth mindset?

#### To me, a growth mindset is a state of mind which permits an individual to learn relatively efficiently by consistently reminding ones-self that not only only is failure very good for learning, but actually necessary. Without failure you can't find your weaknesses and in-turn can't improve on those weaknesses to turn them into a strength. Using this way of thinking allows you to embrace and learn from failure and criticism in a healthy way instead of ignoring and avoiding it which can actually **impede** progress.

- Nothing worth achieving is ever easy.
- Fear is healthy in moderation.
- The best way to learn is to find obstacles to overcome and never feel like asking for help is bad.
