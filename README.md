##### Hi! I'm Matthew Holder, but you can call me Matt. Did you know that we know more about space than we do about our own oceans? It's believed that if humans were to develope a passion for oceanography which rivals that of astronomy scientists of every field would be able to make significant breakthroughs. For this reason, in combination with the abundant evidence to show that crowdsourcing is an outstanding way to make breakthroughs as well, I have made it my mission in life to design deep sea robotics which can be safely modified and used by anyone with a working knowledge of robotics and the potential risks and rewards of oceanography. In order to be capable of accomplishing this feat of engineering I intend to learn web developement so that I can work on touch-screen interfaces for drones, robotics and AI to program these deep sea drones to work well in the intense conditions of the deep and robotics engineering in order to design and build a drone capable of withstanding the extreme pressures, tempuratures and currents while still maintaining communication a safe distance away from the user. I challenge anyone to beat me to it and I'd love to hear about it if you do!
