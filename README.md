# What is a growth mindset?

#### To me, a growth mindset is a state of mind which permits an individual to learn relatively efficiently by consistently reminding ones-self that not only only is failure very good for learning, but actually necessary. Without failure you can't find your weaknesses and in-turn can't improve on those weaknesses to turn them into a strength. Using this way of thinking allows you to embrace and learn from failure and criticism in a healthy way instead of ignoring and avoiding it which can actually **impede** progress.

- Nothing worth achieving is ever easy.
- Fear is healthy in moderation.
- The best way to learn is to find obstacles to overcome and never feel like asking for help is bad.

##### Hi! I'm Matthew Holder, but you can call me Matt. Did you know that we know more about space than we do about our own oceans? It's believed that if humans were to develope a passion for oceanography which rivals that of astronomy scientists of every field would be able to make significant breakthroughs. For this reason, in combination with the abundant evidence to show that crowdsourcing is an outstanding way to make breakthroughs as well, I have made it my mission in life to design deep sea robotics which can be safely modified and used by anyone with a working knowledge of robotics and the potential risks and rewards of oceanography. In order to be capable of accomplishing this feat of engineering I intend to learn web developement so that I can work on touch-screen interfaces for drones, robotics and AI to program these deep sea drones to work well in the intense conditions of the deep and robotics engineering in order to design and build a drone capable of withstanding the extreme pressures, tempuratures and currents while still maintaining communication a safe distance away from the user. I challenge anyone to beat me to it and I'd love to hear about it if you do!

### Things I've learned so far:
- ![Github](https://github.com/holdermatthew5) is basically an entire code language turned into a social media platform.
- Github uses emojis :shushing_face:
  ![Here's](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) a list of usable emojis!
Pressing enter doesn't actually start a new line if you don't start that line with code. It just adds a space between the start of that line and the end of the previous one.
- This ~ is apparently called a tilde, but don't ask me how to pronounce it lol.

- A text editor is the actual platform that creates the website. Github is a text editor. The thing we wrote html and css in for intro to coding 101 was a text editor. One aspect of a text editor is the different colors assigned to each feature and the lack of color in other parts like actual text that appears on the page. This "color-scheme" can be useful in identifying errors as well as making the code more eye friendly or easier to read as opposed to the way this paragraph is all one style of text or the way html writes all words in a website in the same style on different lines.

- There is no "best" text editor it's all about what feels and works best for the individual coder. So far I liked the 101 editor better because of the color scheme and the natural indentation of each line which made the code a little easier for me to make out. Although, this editor is significantly more user friendly in terms of mistakes and the lack of necessity to actually use code to write a paragraph for the site.
