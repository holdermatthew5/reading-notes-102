10010101 + 10111000 = 1+1, 0+0, 0+1, 1+1, 0+1, 1+0, 0+0, 1+0
key<-=carry-over-----1<-0-0<-1-1<-0-1<-0-0<-1-0<-1-0<-0-0<-1
----------------------------------^
10010101 + 10111000 = 101001101
128+16+4+1+128+32+16+8=256+64+8+4+1
-----147 + 182----- = 186 why am I off by 4?

- basic process of computing includes: input, storage, process, output.
- input - takes electrical signals from other computers in the form of electricity and no electricity
- storage - places signals in memory in order recieved to be used later
- process - CPU analyzes signals performing necessary calculations ordered by the signal
- output - new signals are sent back to the source in the form of electricity and no electricity
- computers don't actually do several things at once the OS switches tasks continuously, smoothly and quickly enough to be indistinguishable from multitasking.
