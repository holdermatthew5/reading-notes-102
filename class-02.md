- `<b></b>` = bold
- `<i></i>` = italics
- `<sup></sup>` = exponent (superscript)
- `<sub></sub>` = base (subscript)
- extra spaces make code easier to read and don't do anything to the actual website.
- `<br />` = an "enter" (line break) in text elements.
- `<hr />` = a spacer line (horizontal rule) in between text elements.
- visual editors seem to be programs which allow you to affect the structure of a page without directly writing code.
- semantic markup is used to better define the contents of the page for screen readers and browsers, but can sometimes affect the appearance.
- `<strong></strong>` = this bit is important emphasis it for the screen reader and put it in bold on screen.
- `<em></em>` = ads emphasis to words to subtly change the meaning of a sentence for the screen reader and add italics on screen.
- `<blockquote cite='link'></blockquote>` = shows the contained element to be a quote. Browsers will usually indent the `<p>` contained but general indentation should be done through css.
- `<q></q>` = used to put a shorter quote *inside* a `<p>` tag. both elements can use the cite attribute.
- `<abbr></abbr>` = provides unabbreviated term when mouse hovers over abbreviation
- `<cite></cite>` = used to indicate origin of citation (group or association title not persons name).

- , = targets all elements of selectors listed
- > = targets any specified element directly inside a specified html element
- space = targets any specified element anywhere inside the specified selector. does not have to be direct descendant.
- `+` = targets first adjacent element (first of specified element on the same verticle line).
- latest rule takes precendence over other identical rules affecting the same html element
- !important = overrides latter rules affecting the same element.
- more specific selectors override less specific ones (uses id, class, sibling etc.)
- since specificity affects selectors and timing more likely affects rules specificity overrides timing. Then rules in the more specific still obey !important above all and latest comes in second
- rules in parent elements are inherited by child elements. \[unless latter, mare specific or important overrides any child element?]
- if a less specific selector has a rule that the more specific does not, will the rule still apply?
