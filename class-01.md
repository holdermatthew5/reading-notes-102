## Tell us about yourself
- I have always been interested in science. In particular, I’m interested in doing my part to accelerate the advancement of science in every field. I believe the most efficient way to do that is to create open source drones to be used in oceanography. When looking at the history of hobby rockets and aerial drones the biggest contributing factor in their popularity is the ability to relatively easily and cheaply turn them into a hobby. When people can put their creativity to the test and really learn, understand and modify whatever they’re working with without restriction it just becomes more interesting and more fun. For this reason in combination with the proclaimed lack of interest in oceanography my goal for now is to bring attention to the field by making publicly available an open source deep sea drone. Which is actually why I’m here. One of the most important factors in robotics is their range, so that makes the work you’re doing with wireless charging incredibly important.
## Why should we hire you
- I’m not just here for the money or for the experience. I believe in what you do here and I’d like to see it fully realized. For this reason I’d be taking the success of this company very personally and work hard and smartly to accomplish the mission.
## What is your greatest strength
- I’d consider my ambition to be my greatest strength. It makes me excited to start projects and even more excited to continue through obstacles. For example, in my first website at code fellows I had trouble figuring out what was wrong with a JS function and found myself getting more and more determined to find the answer in less than 15 minutes (we're asked not to stay stuck for longer than 15 minutes without asking for help). I started going over the code the instructor provided as an example and couldn't find what was wrong with it. My 15 min wasn't up yet and I wanted to make sure I exhausted every avenue I could before asking a teammate or the TA/instructor for help, so I went to google. I plugged the element into the console and ran it there. Immediately, it returned that there was an unexpected `(` but I could not find it to save my life. I went back to the instructors example to look for differences and found that I did in fact put parenthesis after an else statement. Once I took those out the function ran perfectly and I was absolutely elated. I felt like I had just conquered the world.
## What is your greatest weakness
- My dreams of the future can sometimes catch hold of me and cause me to think too much about the plan and not act on it in a timely manner. For example, while I was in the Navy I thought way too often about all the different ways I could make money in real estate. My goal was to set up a small realty network before I left the Navy, so I got to planning. I searched the pros and cons of renting vs flipping and of apartments vs houses and compiled insane amounts of data, but by the time I actually thought about forming the loose data into a plan it was already time for me to leave the Navy. It was then that I realized this idea was no longer feasible for me since my income would soon be significantly lees than what I could use to safely act on the idea no matter how perfect the plan was. It was then that I really learned why people so often said that an incomplete plan now was better than a perfect plan later. I won't be trying to form that realty network anymore since it was mainly just a hobby in the first place and I expect to spend most of my time and energy qualifying myself as an expert in robotics and software engineering from now on.
