# CSS-Notes
- box around every element (links count as elements) which is controllable by changing css code
- Text styling is also changable
- remind how to specify which element we want changed when there's more than one of the same element in that spot. (ie. `insert code example here`)
  - Go from top to bottom then what?(2 li which li) `nav>ul> id="1"`
- `p{font-family: Ariel;}` p=selector (which element) f-l;=declaration (what rules apply to that element, so add color font shape italics bold...)
- `{font-family: Ariel;}` font fam= property (which aspect were changing, so size shape color) Ariel=value (what we want it changed to).
- if #ee3e80 and rgb(100, 100, 80) both modify how much red green and blue are in the text color what's the difference?
  - in `#66cdaa` 66=red, 102; cd=green, 205; aa=blue, 170. but when would I use each? 
- premade color names
- `/* words */` (ctrl /)= note not to be interpreted by browser. can be used as reminder or to communicate with other coders reading that line.
- notes can also be used to specify intent of certain lines ('/* color name */ h1 { color: DarkCyan;}`
- don't read search engine optimization (SEO)
- atribute= style in <p style="x">
- can change multiple elements by `h1, h2, h3{color: red;}`
- `.` specifies class in `class="group"`
- `#` specifies id of li
- specificity trumps last rule entered
- use design and laguage to include those who can't see evey color
- `margin: 0px auto;` (does auto mean to center webpage onscreen?
- `float:` moves specified item "out of flow" (can put things side to side, but tends to mess things up)
- `display: inLine-block;` moves `li` side to side instead of naturally occuring top to bottom.
- `border-radius:` 25px; provides a rounded box around specified element
- `header > nav> ul > li > a {color: inherit;}` turns purple clicked link to chosen color in css code
- padding gives "button" a bit of room between text and outline
- `margin-top: 11px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom; 9px margin-left: 8px;` = `margin: 11px 10px 9px 8px;`
